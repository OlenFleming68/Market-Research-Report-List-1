<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cylinder Type</li><li>Cone-Plate Type</li><li>Parallel-Plate Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary viscometer market is categorized into three primary types: cylinder type, cone-plate type, and parallel-plate type. Cylinder type viscometers measure viscosity by rotating a cylinder in the fluid, offering reliable results for a wide range of viscosities. Cone-plate viscometers consist of a cone-shaped rotor and flat plate, providing precise measurements for low-viscosity fluids. Parallel-plate viscometers utilize two plates separated by a gap, ideal for characterizing thicker fluids and offering consistent shear rate control. Each type serves different applications across industries.</p></p>
