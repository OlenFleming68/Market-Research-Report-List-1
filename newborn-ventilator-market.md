<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Newborn Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The newborn ventilator market comprises two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require intubation, delivering mechanical breaths directly to the lungs through an endotracheal tube. This method is often used for critically ill infants needing precise respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory assistance without intubation, utilizing techniques like continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Non-invasive options are generally preferred for their comfort and reduced risk of complications.</p></p>
