<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RJ45 Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RJ45 connector market is primarily categorized into shielded and unshielded types. Shielded RJ45 connectors contain metal shielding that helps protect signals from electromagnetic interference (EMI), making them ideal for environments with high electromagnetic noise, such as industrial settings. Unshielded RJ45 connectors, on the other hand, lack this shielding, making them more cost-effective and suitable for standard networking applications in low-interference areas. The choice between the two largely depends on the specific requirements of the network environment.</p></p>
