<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Non invasive Ventilator NIV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilator</li><li>BIPAP Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sleep non-invasive ventilation (NIV) market primarily features two main types: CPAP and BiPAP ventilators. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines deliver a constant air pressure to keep the airway open, primarily used for obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) devices provide two levels of pressure: a higher pressure during inhalation and a lower pressure during exhalation, catering to patients with more complex respiratory conditions. Both types enhance sleep quality and overall respiratory health.</p></p>
