<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tap Changer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OLTC</li><li>DETC/NLTC/OCTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tap changer market comprises various types of devices that regulate voltage levels in transformers. On-load tap changers (OLTC) adjust settings without de-energizing, ensuring stable voltage during operation. Detachable tap changers (DETC) and non-load tap changers (NLTC) are utilized when the transformer is offline, allowing for manual adjustments. Off-circuit tap changers (OCTC) also require a shutdown for changes, primarily used in less frequent voltage adjustments. Each type plays a crucial role in maintaining electrical system efficiency and reliability.</p></p>
