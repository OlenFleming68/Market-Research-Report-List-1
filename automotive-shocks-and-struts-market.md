<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Shocks And Struts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shocks</li><li>Struts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive shocks and struts market comprises two main types: shocks and struts. Shocks, or shock absorbers, are components that dampen vibrations and stabilize vehicle movement by absorbing impacts from uneven surfaces. Struts, on the other hand, are structural parts of the suspension system, combining shock absorption with support for the vehicle's weight and alignment. Both play crucial roles in ensuring ride comfort, handling, and safety, with shocks being standalone units and struts integrating multiple suspension functions into a single assembly.</p></p>
