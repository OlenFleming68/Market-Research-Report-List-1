<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specimen retrieval market is categorized into two main types: detachable and non-detachable devices. Detachable inserters allow for the separation of the specimen from the retrieval device, enabling easier handling and transportation of the specimen post-surgery. In contrast, non-detachable devices retain the specimen within the retrieval apparatus until it is entirely removed from the body. Both types serve critical roles in minimally invasive surgeries, facilitating effective biopsy and tissue collection while minimizing trauma to the surrounding tissue.</p></p>
